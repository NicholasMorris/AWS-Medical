  "full_transcript": "Good morning. How can I help you today? Hi, I've been having these headaches lately and I wanted to get them checked out. I see. Can you tell me about the headache? When did it start? When did they start? They started about 2 weeks ago. At first it was just now and then, but lately it's been more frequent. How often would you say they occur now? Almost every day. And how long do they usually last when you get them? A few hours, sometimes it lingers most of the day. Can you describe the pain? Is it throbbing, sharp, or more of a pressure? More like a dull pressure sometimes on both sides of my head. Do you notice anything that makes it worse or better? It seems worse when I've been working on my computer for a long time. If I take some paracetamol and rest, it usually eases a bit. Are there any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light or sound or vision changes? No vomiting or vision changes. Sometimes I feel a bit tired and sensitive to light when it's bad. Any history of head injury, recent illness, or fever? No, none of those. Do you have any medical conditions or take any regular medications? No medical conditions and no regular medications. How's your sleep been lately? Not great. I've been going to bed late because of work. How about stress levels? Pretty high. I've got a lot of deadlines at the moment. OK, understood. Just a few more questions. Have you noticed weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or problems with balance? No, nothing like that. OK. From what you've described, these headaches and most consistent with tension type headaches, likely related to posture, screen time and stress. There are no red flag symptoms suggesting something more serious, but I'll examine you to be sure. Your examination looks normal. My advice is to focus on regular breaks from screens, good hydration, regular meals, and improving sleep where you can. Over the counter pain relief is fine if needed, but try to limit or try to limit to avoid rebound headaches. OK, that makes sense. I'll also give you some information on relaxation techniques and posture exercises. If the headaches worsen suddenly change in nature, or if you develop new symptoms such as vomiting, visual changes, weakness or confusion, it's important to seek medical help straight away. Got it, thank you. You're welcome. Let's review in a few weeks if things don't improve and consider further investigation if needed. Sounds good. Thanks again. Take care.",
